The other pane will stop or jump ahead as needed to keep the content aligned.\n- You may switch between the files to change which is the \"master\" and which is the \"slave\".\n- To stop syncing, click on `SrclSync` in the status bar or close one of the tabs.\n\n#License\n\nCopyright Mark Hahn by MIT license.",
