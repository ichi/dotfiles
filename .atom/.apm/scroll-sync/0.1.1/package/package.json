The other pane will stop or jump ahead as needed to keep the content aligned.\n- You may switch between the files to change which is the \"master\" and which is the \"slave\".\n- To stop syncing, click on `SrclSync` in the status bar or close one of the tabs.\n\n#License\n\nCopyright Mark Hahn by MIT license.","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mark-hahn/scroll-sync/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mark-hahn/scroll-sync","_id":"scroll-sync@0.1.1","_shasum":"38c6eddaad834ac2aaa6a24028fe282324cb71a6","_resolved":"file:../d-115210-57043-31s6tj/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115210-57043-31s6tj/package.tgz"}
